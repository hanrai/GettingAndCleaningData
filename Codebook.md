Codebook
========================================================

Please read features_info.txt and features.txt for detail. Tidy dataset share the same colnames with train or test data. You can find almost all informations you need in those two documents.

## Difference:
### Added columns:
* subject: The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
* activity: Activity names (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 

## Why not change the names for columns?
Keep the same name will reduce learning time, you need only one copy of code book in your hand plus a piece of paper, not two books. You don't need to open different documents when you read two datasets at the same time. And this document will cost you very little time to read, save time to do valuable things.
